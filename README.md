# Networking Project - Final Year

This project is a networking simulation created using **Cisco Packet Tracer** to demonstrate various networking concepts and configurations.

## Project Overview

The project showcases the implementation of core networking principles, including:
- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** for automated IP address assignment.
- **Domain Name System (DNS)** configuration for name resolution.
- **Web Servers and File Servers** setup for hosting services.
- **Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)** for network segmentation.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)** for IP address conservation.
- **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)** for dynamic routing between multiple routers.

## Topology Diagram

The topology includes:
- Multiple routers and switches interconnected.
- End devices such as PCs and servers.
- Configuration of IP addressing, subnetting, and routing.

## Features Implemented

- **DHCP Configuration**: Provides automatic IP addressing to end devices.
- **DNS Server**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **VLANs**: Isolates traffic within specific segments of the network.
- **NAT Configuration**: Allows private IP addresses to communicate over public networks.
- **RIP Routing**: Ensures efficient routing between different networks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Cisco Packet Tracer (version X.X or later) installed on your machine.

### How to Open the Project

1. Download the `.pkt` file from this repository.
2. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Click on **File** > **Open**, and select the downloaded `.pkt` file.

## Usage

- Modify device configurations to explore different networking scenarios.
- Add or remove devices to extend the network as needed.
- Test connectivity using the **ping** tool and other simulation features in Packet Tracer.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates key networking skills and provides a hands-on environment to practice network design and configuration using Cisco Packet Tracer. It is suitable for educational purposes and skill development.
